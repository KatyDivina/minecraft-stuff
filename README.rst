Minecraft - Stuff Library
=========================

An extension library of useful 'stuff' (aka classes) I have created for Minecraft: Pi Edition's API.  

It provides functions for drawing lines, creating, moving and rotating shapes and a pretty cool turtle.  Check out the `documentation`_ and `examples`_.

Created by `Martin O'Hanlon`_, `@martinohanlon`_, `stuffaboutco.de`_.

Open a terminal and run the following commands::

    git clone https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-stuff
    cd minecraft-stuff
    sudo python setup.py install
    sudo python3 setup.py install
